# QLight
An ambient lighting system developed on a [Digilent Zybo
Z7-10](https://store.digilentinc.com/zybo-z7-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-development-board/) as part of my final
year project at the University of York. Created for Vivado 2018.2

This project is based on the [Zybo Z7-10 HDMI Input/Output Demo](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/zybo-z7-hdmi-demo/start)
